# CS659A_Project_MATLAB-CODES-and-BENCHMARKS
For the codes, we simply need to run the code on MATLAB. 
Initial value of the variables are given randomly.
Value of epison is given such that no unbounded or infeasible error is generated.

While running the codes, two dialog box appears where in the first one, it plots output(y1 and u1) generated by the controller in presence of no noise/disturbances. Bw, Du, Dw matrices are nullified in the first case.
Then another dialog box appears where noises are added on to the model at specific time intervals. Plot shows change in values of 'y1'  and 'u1' with the addition of noise 'w1' on to the model. 

The blue lines represent the states, inputs and outputs of the plant.
The green dashed lines represents the predictions of the model of the controller.
